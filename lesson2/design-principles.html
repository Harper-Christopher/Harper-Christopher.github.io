    <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Apple <br><a target="blank" href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple's Link</a></li>
    </ul>

    <img id="photo" src="img/apple.jpg" alt="Photo of Apple's Website">

    <p>Apple has used the visual hierarchy with your focus first seeing the image of the phone which
     immediatly you know exactly what the webpage is about. Then the next focus is the iPhone 11 Pro words sense
      it's the next biggest image on the page, so it shows what phone and model that is being displayed below it. 
      Then below more details about it, and oddly enough the pricing last and smallest.</p>

    <h2>Hick's Law</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Amazon Deals: <br><a target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/goldbox/?pf_rd_p=dfe13b09-3b88-422f-bc64-07ef802d4688&pf_rd_r=YD11BB9H0F2YSD77TMMG">Amazon's Link</a></li>
    </ul>

    <img id="photo" src="img/amazon.jpg" alt="Photo of Amazon's Website">

    <p>Amazon has always been one to keep me pre-occupied looking for things I need. But through the filters they have 
      created a perfect example of Hick's Law as they can turn a page that has endless items to scroll through which
      can make it almost impossible to find exactly what you're looking for to one that can really narrow down what 
      you're looking for a save a ton of time in the process. With the filters they've made it so you can 
      filter your search to find anything from brands, to customer reviews. This has helped reduce the time spent 
      looking through things that might not be an exact match for what you were looking for.

    <h2>Fitt's Law</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Mormon Message Videos: <br> <a target="blank" href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/inspiration/latter-day-saints-channel/watch/series/mormon-messages/the-will-of-god-2?lang=eng">The Church Of Jesus Christ's Link</a></li>
    </ul>

    <img id="photo" src="img/thewillofgod.jpg" alt="Photo of The Will Of God video">

    <p>Taken from one of my favorite church videos, I believe this is a perfect example of Fitt's Law as they've made 
      the play button very large in the middle of the video so it's quick and easy to use as explained in the Fitt's Law example. </p>
